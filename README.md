# NoSQL Analysis and Exploration

## Overview

<!-- Overview of the Module -->
This repository contains an analysis and exploration of a NoSQL database. The analysis aims to demonstrate the utilization of NoSQL databases for data manipulation, querying, and exploration. The dataset used pertains to UK food establishments and covers various aspects of these establishments.

## Contents

- `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the NoSQL analysis and data exploration. Utilizes Python with the PyMongo library for database interactions and Pandas for data manipulation.
- `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with instructions for setting up the NoSQL database. Covers database creation, data import, and basic queries.
- `README.md`: This document, detailing the project and its components.
